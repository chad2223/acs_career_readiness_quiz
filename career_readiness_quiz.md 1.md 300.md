Hi Douglas,

I recently started at BloomTech, and Iâ€™m finishing up Unit 1 right now! Iâ€™ve been trying to connect with professionals in the tech industry to learn more about their journeys, and I came across your profile during my research. Iâ€™m truly impressed by your career pathâ€”your transition from Data Analyst to Data Scientist at Johnson & Johnson is an incredible accomplishment. Leading strategic initiatives like forecasting orthopedic procedures and optimizing market opportunities sounds like impactful and rewarding workâ€”congrats on your success!

Right now, Iâ€™m looking for advice on how I can set myself apart in the job market as I prepare for my career transition. Would you be open to connecting for a 20-minute call so I could ask you a few questions? Iâ€™d love to hear more about your experiences at Johnson & Johnson and any insights you might have.

Please feel free to grab a time that works for you on my Calendly https://calendly.com/chadfauria1340431/30min

Looking forward to speaking with you soon!

Best regards,
Chad
